> D means DBpedia, W means Wikidata, and Y means YOGO3.

> SRPRS means segment-based random PageRank sampling, while IDS means Iterative degree-based sampling. Both of them indicates that several EA benchmarks (e.g., DBP15K and DWY100K) contain much more highdegree entities than real-world KGs do.

> DBP1M was proposed by LargeEA, which mainly focus on the Large-scale Knowledge Graphs.
